Use @prose-coder to review your CHANGE (not the rest of the code, JUST your change), and whittle it down (IF APPLICABLE) to a clean diff. While you are reviewing your change ONLY, review it in _context_ of whole (applicable) files.

You can check what changed with either `git diff` or `git diff --staged`.
